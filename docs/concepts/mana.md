# Mana
## Types of Mana
There are only 2 main types of Mana; Primal Mana and General Mana.
If the term Mana is used on its own, then it should be assumed
that you are referring to General Mana.

### Mana Signatures
Additionally, General Mana has signatures, which are imprints of the
environment and elements it has been exposed to.
Unsigned Mana exists, but typically gains a signature after exposure
to any non-sterile environment after 3 minutes.

Over time, Mana Signatures get stronger and morph with exposure
to the environment and/or Mana that does not share the same signature.

    delicate environments can cause negative effects.

## The Origin of Mana
Mana is a type of energy created from the decay of Dark Matter, a
form of matter that is abundant in the universe and will never run
out due to the constant expansion of it.

Primal Mana is the raw, unprocessed and purest form of Mana, and
happens to be extremely toxic to souls with even the tiniest
impurities.

Over time, as celestial bodies form, Primal Mana gathers within
the same spots that stardust and other material does, and acts as a
catalyst to speed up the process. Due to the intensity of this
process, it breaks down Primal Mana into Mana.
