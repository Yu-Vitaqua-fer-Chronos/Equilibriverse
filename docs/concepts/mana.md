# Mana
## Types of Mana
There are only 2 main types of Mana; Primal Mana and General Mana.
If the term Mana is used on its own, then it should be assumed
that you are referring to General Mana.

### Mana Signatures
Additionally, General Mana has signatures, which are imprints of the
environment and elements it has been exposed to.
Unsigned Mana exists, but typically gains a signature after exposure
to any non-sterile environment after 3 minutes.

Over time, Mana Signatures get stronger and morph with exposure
to the environment and/or Mana that does not share the same signature.

    delicate environments can cause negative effects.
