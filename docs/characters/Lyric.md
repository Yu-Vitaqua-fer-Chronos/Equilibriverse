## Affinity
Amelia used to have the affinity known as Energy Transmutation,
which allowed for the user to losslessly convert any type of
energy into another. For example; Mana to electricity, Chemical to
kinetic and even mana to chemical energy. But due to circumstances
that will be detailed later on in the article, she now has no
affinity.

## Personality
Amelia is very bubbly and affectionate to her friends,
always making an effort to be kind, and doing her best to improve her
the moods of those considered close to her.

Amelia is like an open book, with nothing to hide from others, and
is always willing to learn or teach others what she knows. Despise the
airheaded persona that she displays, she is quite adept when it
comes to her studies.
